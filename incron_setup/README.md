asciidoc-environment
====================


These files and scripts allow an easy way for me to use asciidoc.

In short, this sets up an environment that allows me to easily produce pdf files.

This sets up a command that allows me to edit an asciidoc file, while its being editted, a pdf viewer is opened and is updated as I write changes to the file. This is almost real-time (or as real-time as I want it).

It also setups up syntax highlighting and keymappings within vim.

The sytax highlighting is taken from Dag Wieers GitHub repository. The files from his repository are not included here, only links to it.

See the docs directory for more information.
